# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

This code integrates HTML for interface, JavaScript for logic, and CSS for style. JavaScript manages user input, compares choices, updates scores, and controls game flow. Users select rock, paper, or scissors; the computer randomly chooses, determining round winners. Interactive UI offers visual feedback for each round played.
